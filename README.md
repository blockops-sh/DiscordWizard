# DiscordWizard: Your Portal to Discord Server Replication üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the world of DiscordWizard, your trusty ally for cloning entire Discord servers. With its unique and efficient powers, DiscordWizard will help you mirror a Discord server in no time.

To work with DiscordWizard, you'll need:
- The token of a Discord account that is a member of the server you wish to copy
- A target server where the messages will be replicated, along with the token of an account with administrative privileges
- That's it! You're ready to go.

## How DiscordWizard Works üé©

DiscordWizard operates by having the account in the source server monitor changes and new messages using a websocket. The target account then replicates these changes, creating categories, channels, and even renaming them as needed. Messages are sent through webhooks, ensuring a seamless connection between servers.

To set up DiscordWizard, configure the `settings.yaml` file as shown:

```yaml
client:
  token: "" # Token of the account in the server to be mirrored
  server_id: 107... # Server ID
  excluded_channels:
    - 0 # List of excluded channels, if any
  regex_filter: "(badword1|badword2)" # Regex to block forwarding of messages based on it

server:
  token: "" # Administrator token within your server
  server_id: 109... # Your server ID
  interval: 60 # Delay in seconds between interactions with Discord APIs to create channels/webhooks/categories
  webhook_name: "DiscordWizard" # Webhook name to use
  websocket:
    port: 8080 # Port to use
    host: "localhost" # Host to use
```
Additionally, you can use the `proxies.txt` file to provide a list of proxies to prevent hitting Discord rate limits when mirroring large servers with high message volume. List one proxy per line in the format `ip:port:user:pass` or `ip:port`.

To start the server, run:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
To launch the client, execute:
```bash
python3 client.py
```
And just like that, the replication begins! üéâ

DiscordWizard separates the client and server into two different scripts. This versatile design allows you to mirror multiple source servers (clients) to the same target server, broadening your possibilities and streamlining the process.

*Note*: The first time you run DiscordWizard, it will create channels, categories, and webhooks. This may take a moment due to Discord's rate limit restrictions. For larger servers, use a higher interval (40/60) to avoid hitting Discord's rate limits.
